In alignment with my life's intention to be a visionary writer, I offer a monthly-ish email update to connect with my community and to inspire as you take authentic action in your life.

* [Get the Artist's Instructions][0]
* I wrote in my first poetry collection that my highest aspiration in life is to be "a wily old grandfather armed with a collection of true tall tales for his grandchildren." Naturally, I'm a bit of a storyteller. A self-published [poet][1] and [musician][2].

There may be stories of breakthroughs, opportunities to connect and build community with other people doing creative work, and wisdom to pass along from many sources.

I'd love to keep in touch with you! **[Are you in? Join me today!][0]**
