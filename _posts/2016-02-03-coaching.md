# Coaching for the World You'd Love to Live In

About five years ago, I printed out 1000 cards with three Artist's Instructions. Since then, they've been offered to and taken to heart by people on five continents.

From the many conversations in which I've offered the Artist's Instructions, I've noticed that the most profound challenges arise when we work to bring our greatest visions and our most authentic selves into physical reality. Looking at these structures of knowing about ourselves can bring about incredible transformations as we make those challenges speech-ripe and take action despite experiencing a fear of our own success.

> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. -Marianne Williamson 

Life coaching offers us opportunities and tools to truly observe those places where we struggle and pause, and calls upon us to take courageous, authentic action in giving our gifts to the world -- with increasing clarity and ease.

## What kind of breakthrough would you love to achieve in your life and work?

In my coaching practice, I offer tools from many sources, including the coaching methods of Coaching for Social Change, the Academy for Coaching Excellence and the Transformative Action Institute; the ethics and best practices of the Permaculture movement; and the wisdom of the world's spiritual traditions. My bottom line is to support you in living the life you dream of with clarity, focus, ease, and grace.

Are you curious if coaching could benefit you in your most cherished pursuits? If so, I'd love to offer you a free 50-minute exploratory session to see how coaching can be right for you.
